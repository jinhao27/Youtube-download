# Youtube-download# YouTube-script
This is a youtube video downloading script created using Selenium and Python that automates the youtube to mp3/youtube to mp4 process. It takes in youtube links as input, and the user has choice for customizing their download request. The user can choose between downloadng one youtube video or multiple, as well as between downloading the youtube video(s) as mp3 or mp4. Error trapping to a certain degree has been done so that users can still input youtube links properly and make their choices even if they mistyped something.

## Motivation
I've always been an avid downloader of youtube videos, whether it be videos or just music. I've enjoyed downloadng from youtube because of the sheer variety of videos and the simplicity of doing it. This was fine and all for when I was downloading music to my phone's original music app. I started sharing spotify accounts with friends, and sometimes only youtube had a specific cover or type of audio that I was looking for. Manually downloading music became tedious, and that is when this script came to life!
